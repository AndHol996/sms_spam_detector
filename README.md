# sms_spam_detector
***
## Description
This program refactors code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. After the model is created and trained, a gradio app will launch where the user can input text to tell whether a text is classified as spam or not.

## Project Status
The code is at a stable state. May revise the code in order to further understand supervised machine learning models.

## Conditions
The specifications for this program is that it is running on Python 3.10.14 for a Conda environment and imported pandas, layers and Model from Pipeline, train_test_split, TfidfVectorizer, and LinearSVC from scikit-learn, and gradio.
